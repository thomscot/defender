A simple web application born out of a discussion regarding the huge amount of loan words in modern Japanese language.

The idea is to create a cultural association aiming to promote the use native Japanese (or Sino-Japanese) words over the tremendous amount of loan words introduced over the past decades, often for no apparent reason, especially from English. Most of such loanwords could be easilty replaced by already existing words.

The association also promotes the creation of new words to replace existing loan words in an effort to reduce their number and drive the Japanese language according to a common aesthetic sense.

**Use:**

At the current stage, the purpose is very simple: the promotion of an idea and the acquisition of members. Users who wishes to join the association can do so by filling a form and registering into a database. A simple dictionary that suggests a "translation" loan word/native Japanese is also provided.
