A simple web application for a cultural association aiming to preserve the Japanese language against the tremendous amount of loan words introduced over the past decades, often for no real reason. It is the opinion of the founders and members that most of such laon words could be replaced with already existing native Japanese words. The association also promotes the creation of new words to replace existing loan words in an effort to reduce their number and drive the Japanese language according to a common aesthetic sense.

**Use:**

At the current stage, the purpose is very simple: mostly the promotion of an idea and the acquisition of members. Users who wishes to join the association can do so by filling a form and registering into a database. A simple dictionary that suggests a "translation" loan word/native Japanese is also provided.
