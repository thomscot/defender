日本語はもう死んでいるのか。
What happened to the beautiful language that our fathers and the fathers of our fathers used to speak and write? 

Everything eveolves, and rightly so. Evolution and constant change are what drives our universe. Everything is dynamic, and has the seasons change so do languages.
However, such changes must be harmonius yet I fail to see any trace of "和" in the way the Japanese language has been mutilated in the past decades. Every language has a set of loan words, 
this is probably inevitable given the times we live in and there is nothing wrong with that. However, one must not sacrifice a beautiful and rich vocabulary that has been built over centuries 
over shallow replacements for which there is no real need. 

With this manifesto proposal and mission goes along the following lines:

- Limit the use of loan words to when strictly needed promoting the use of traditional Japanese words.
- Try to enrich the our language by creating Japanese words to replace loan words.
- Come up with a list of acceptable loanwords, according to how much such words are indeed used internationally (that is, how many other languages agreed to use such a loan).
- Remove loan words that will be considered as not necessary from the vocabulary.
- Start using katakana only for loan words, that is, words considered part of the Japanese language. Use wesetern alphabet in the other cases.*

* We believe that over the years the excessive use of katakana for words that are not and not meant to be part of the Japanese language (e.g. view -> ビュー) will lead to an increase of loan words.

Disclaimer: this association and this text are meant not to have and never will have any political association. This is a cultural association for the protection and preservation of the Japanese language.
It does not mean in any way to discriminate foreign residents in Japan, foreign languages, nado. On the contrary, we very much welcome opinions and members from any race, gender, and religion who wish to support
our cause.
